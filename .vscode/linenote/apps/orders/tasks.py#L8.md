Certainly! Here's a sample code that demonstrates how to handle the "order_created" trigger, create a new instance of the order, process the JSON data, and create a user and customer if necessary:

```python
import json
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.conf import settings
from .models import Order, Product, Customer

def handle_order_created(json_data):
    # Parse the JSON data
    order_data = json.loads(json_data)
    order_items = order_data

    # Extract order details
    order_id = order_data.get("orderId")
    customer_email = order_data.get("customerEmail")
    # ... extract other relevant information from the JSON data

    # Check if the customer already exists or create a new user and customer
    try:
        user = User.objects.get(email=customer_email)
    except User.DoesNotExist:
        # Create a new user
        user = User.objects.create_user(
            username=customer_email,
            email=customer_email,
            password=settings.DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD  # Set a default password
        )

    try:
        customer = Customer.objects.get(user=user)
    except Customer.DoesNotExist:
        # Create a new customer
        customer = Customer.objects.create(user=user, email=customer_email)
        # ... populate other customer fields if needed

    # Create a new instance of the order
    order = Order.objects.create(
        order_id=order_id,
        customer=customer,
        # ... set other order fields based on the extracted data
    )

    # Process the order items
    for order_item in order_items:
        product_data = order_item

        # Create a new instance of the product and associate it with the order
        product = Product.objects.create(
            order=order,
            # ... set other product fields based on the extracted data
        )

        # ... process other nested JSON data if needed

    # Perform additional business logic or validations for the order
    # ... perform calculations, generate invoices, send notifications, etc.

    # Save the changes in the database
    order.save()

    # Trigger further actions or notifications if needed
    # ... notify the customer, update analytics, trigger downstream processes, etc.
```

In the above code, the `handle_order_created` function takes the JSON data as input and performs the necessary steps to handle the "order_created" trigger. It extracts the relevant information from the JSON, checks if the customer exists or creates a new user and customer, creates a new instance of the order, processes the order items, performs additional business logic, and saves the changes in the database.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to adapt it to your specific requirements and models. Additionally, make sure to handle error cases, validate the JSON data, and add appropriate error handling and exception handling in your implementation.
